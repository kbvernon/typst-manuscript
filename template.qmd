  In this episode, Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) plays a 1960s secret 
  agent in a holosuite game, accompanied by his friend Garak (Andrew Robinson), 
  who is himself a former spy. After a transporter accident, the physical 
  likenesses of several crew members are temporarily stored as characters in the 
  holosuite memory; Bashir and Garak must prevent any of them from dying in the 
  game or else they will be lost to the real world.
